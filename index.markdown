Currently I’m building <a href="http://backdrop.so" target="_blank">Backdrop.so</a>. Read more about me here.

Generally speaking, I care about how humans build things, together, via networks. I maintain this site because it forces me to do some gardening of things or ideas I like or have helped create. So it is for me, most of all. But it is also a bat signal to anyone that finds that garden interesting — I hope we can connect or work together.

On that note, the easiest way to reach me is on [Twitter][mytwitter] or [Telegram][mytelegram]. Many of the most rewarding moments and collaborations in my life have come from cold connections based on shared interests, so please do reach out!

I send ~ one update every month, either an original essay or a collection of stuff I’ve found. Subscribe here if you’d like to follow along.
