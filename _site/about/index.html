<p>Currently I am the founder of <a href="backdrop.so">Backdrop</a> — our goal is to build a decentralized protocol for professional networks. In short, we want to build a core piece of digital infrastructure that helps people create amazing things together.</p>

<p>Prior to Backdrop I led product at ResearchGate, and Feastly before that. And prior to tech I studied multiple sclerosis in labs at UCSF and Johns Hopkins.</p>
