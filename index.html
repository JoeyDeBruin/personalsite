I'm in the process of redoing this over the holidays :) In the meantime, head over to <a href="https://flyingpenguins.io">FlyingPenguins.io</a> to read my essays.

Currently I'm building Backdrop.so. Read more about me here.

Generally speaking, I care about how humans build things, together, via networks. I maintain this site because it forces me to do some gardening of things or ideas I like or have helped create. So it is for me, most of all. But it is also a bat signal to anyone that finds that garden interesting — I hope we can connect or work together.

On that note, the easiest way to reach me is on Twitter or Telegram. Many of the most rewarding moments and collaborations in my life have come from cold connections based on shared interests, so please do reach out!

I send ~ one update every month, either an original essay or a collection of stuff I've found. Subscribe here if you'd like to follow along.
